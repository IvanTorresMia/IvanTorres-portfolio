# IvanTorres-portfolio

## Description 
This Webstie is essentially a portfolio about Who I am with three parts to the website. Starting with the **About Me** you can read some dummy google generated text. The the **Portfolio** page will show a container holding place holder images that I found on Google. Moving along to the **Contact** page you will be presented with a form that does absolutely nothing right now because I havent learned just yet how to actually make it work. How do you access these pages? Well I prvide you with a super cool **Navigation** bar in that has all of your options as to which page you want to visit. To top it off, or more so to "bottom" it off we have the footer (pun intended).
